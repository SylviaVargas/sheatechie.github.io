#  Intro to Puerto Rican Genealogy Research


##  Starting your journey to your family history

    To start your genealogy journey, you need to start with a couple of important tools:


- A physical notebook or using a computer to write.  When I started my genealogy journey back in 1991, I started my genealogy research with a pen and paper.   \

- A list of questions to ask yourself and your family
- Time with yourself to think and write what you know and learn
- Patience to be with yourself and family to ask questions and listen to their answers.  Most of our Puerto Rican families have endured and suffered in so many ways that are unimaginable to most of us.  Showing our love and respect with our patience will give you more than just facts.
- For every piece of information, note where and who you got your information.

#  Questions to start your Genealogy Journey

As you delve into your ancestor's life, these questions will help you gather a comprehensive understanding of their background, experiences, and contributions to your family's history.


I suggest that the first ancestor you work with is yourself.  Practice writing answers for yourself will help you ask questions of your family.


     

- **Full Name:*- What is the full name of the ancestor you're researching, including any variations or nicknames?
- **Date of Birth: **When and where was your ancestor born?  Specify the town/city and the country.  If you are not sure, list possible towns they may have lived.
- **Parents' Information: **What were the names and birthplaces of your ancestor's parents?  Be specific as possible.  If not
- Marital Status: Was your ancestor married, and if so, what was their spouse's name?
- **Occupation: **What was your ancestor's occupation or profession?
- **Residences: **Where did your ancestor live throughout their life, and did they move frequently?  List any towns you are aware of where they may have lived.
- **Military Service:*- Did your ancestor serve in any wars or military branches? \
If your ancestor as male and living between 1917-191 or 1940-45 in Puerto Rico or US mainland, they may have been registered for the draft.  This information can be found for free in FamilySearch.org.
- **Education: **Did your ancestor receive formal education, and if so, where and for how long?  Do you know if they could read or write?  This information will help tell your family story of how they survived at the time, regardless of education.
- **Religion**: What religious affiliations or beliefs did your ancestor hold?
- **Children**: Did your ancestor have children, and if so, what were their names and birthdates?
- **Social and Community Involvement:*- Was your ancestor involved in community organizations, clubs, or social groups?
- **Immigration and Naturalization:*- If applicable, when and where did your ancestor immigrate to the country, and did they become a naturalized citizen? \
If your ancestor was born in Puerto Rico before 1898, they were Spanish citizens and most automatically became US citizens on March 2, 1917 when US President Woodrow Wilson signed the Jones-Shafroth Act.
- **Death and Burial:*- When and where did your ancestor pass away?  Do you know where they were buried?  If you know cemetery and can visit, you call the cemetery and ask if they have records of who is buried there
- **Documentation**: Do you have any official documents related to your ancestor, such as birth certificates, marriage licenses, or wills?
- **Photographs**: Do you have any photographs of your ancestor or their immediate family members?
- **Family Stories:*- Are there any family stories or oral traditions about your ancestor that might provide additional information or insights?
- **Historical Context**: What major historical events or time periods did your ancestor live through, and how might this have influenced their life? \
Do you of any hurricanes they lived through?
- **Extended Family: **Can you identify and gather information about your ancestor's siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins?
- **Name Changes or Aliases: **Did your ancestor use different names or aliases at any point in their life?
- **Obituaries and Mass Cards:*- Have you searched for obituaries or news articles related to your ancestor's life and passing?  In my Puerto Rican family research, my mom shared with me funeral cards (also known as mass/prayer cards) with the name of the deceased with their death date and place and in some case their date of birth.  In Puerto Rico, I never found obituaries, but that could be my family hometown.
- **Cultural or Ethnic Traditions:*- Are there specific cultural or ethnic traditions that might provide clues about your ancestor's life and values?  Were they religious?  What religion did they follow? Did they go to church every Sunday?  What church did they attend?   Did your town or family town have yearly celebrations?  In Puerto Rico, every town celebrated Fiesta Patronales.  Check out [WIkipedia: Puerto Rico Fiesta Patronales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiestas_patronales_in_Puerto_Rico).  Some relatives will remember the fiestas of their town, which will give you clues where they lived or where they visited.
